# Tic-Tac-Toe with ReactJS

An interactive tic-tac-toe game built as part of the [introductory tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the official React website.

This version of the tic-tac-toe stores the history of moves during the game, allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board, and highlights the winning squares.
